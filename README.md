# json_api

Per freeCodeCamp https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-simple-json-api-in-python/, I setup a JSON API with Python and Flask on my local machine. The JSON API allows me to use curl to POST information to an "artist" table and to filter, sort, paginate and retrieve the data through the URL.
